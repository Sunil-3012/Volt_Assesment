# Site Network Plan

Review `data/site_spec.json` for the customer site specification.

## VLAN Design

<!-- Define VLANs for the site. Consider:
- Camera VLAN (isolated from other traffic)
- Management VLAN
- Edge device placement
- Existing VLANs from site_spec.json
-->

| VLAN ID | Name | Subnet | Purpose |
|---------|------|--------|---------|
| | | | |

## IP Addressing Scheme

<!-- Define static IP assignments for key devices and DHCP ranges for cameras -->

## Camera Network Isolation

<!-- How will you isolate camera traffic from management and corporate networks? -->

## Edge Device Network Configuration

<!-- Describe the network setup for the edge device (which NIC connects to which VLAN, IP assignments, routing) -->

## Traffic Flow

<!-- Describe how video data flows from cameras through the edge device to the cloud -->
