# Monitoring and Observability Setup

## Metrics

<!-- What metrics would you collect? Consider:
- Application-level metrics (request latency, error rate, throughput)
- Infrastructure metrics (CPU, memory, disk, network)
- Business metrics (video chunks processed, upload success rate)
- Edge device metrics
-->

## SLOs (Service Level Objectives)

<!-- Define SLOs for the video analytics platform. Consider:
- Availability target
- Latency targets
- Data freshness (how stale can video data be?)
- Edge device uptime
-->

## Alerting

<!-- Define alerting rules and thresholds. Consider:
- What triggers a page vs. a ticket?
- Alert fatigue prevention
- Escalation path
-->

## Escalation

<!-- Define the escalation process:
- L1: automated response
- L2: on-call engineer
- L3: senior/specialist
- When to involve customers
-->

## Dashboards

<!-- What dashboards would you create? What's on each one? -->
