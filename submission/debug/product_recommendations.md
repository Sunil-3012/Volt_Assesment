# Product & Engineering Recommendations

Based on your investigation of the debug scenario, provide recommendations for improving the platform.

## Monitoring Improvements

<!-- What monitoring should be added to detect this class of issue earlier? -->

## Automated Detection

<!-- How could the system automatically detect and potentially self-heal from this type of failure? -->

## Platform Changes

<!-- What changes to the product/platform would reduce the likelihood or impact of similar incidents? -->

## Edge Device Improvements

<!-- What improvements to edge device management would help? Consider:
- Configuration management
- Change control
- Automated validation
-->
